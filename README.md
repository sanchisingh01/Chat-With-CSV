# DataWiz
An app that allows you to ask questions to your CSV file

This is a Python application that enables you to load a CSV file and ask questions about its contents using natural language. The application leverages Language Models (LLMs) to generate responses based on the CSV data. The LLM will only provide answers related to the information present in the CSV.

The application is designed to handle CSV files and analyze the data within them. It leverages OpenAI's LLMs and Langchain Agents to provide answers to your queries. The CSV agent uses various tools to discover solutions to your questions and form suitable responses using an LLM. Additionally, it uses Streamlit to create a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) and interacts with the LLM through Langchain.
